## Run

Since the na√Øve extension hasn't been published to market, you can download the source code and open it in VS Code. After you type `Ctrl+F5`, a new window will appear. By typing `SHIFT+SPACE+P` and then inputing `CBA`, the extension will be launched.

## TODO

1. Plot a broken line graph to show the change of CPS and Accuracy.
2. Mine the coding content and analyze it for more interesting conclusion.
