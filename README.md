# Coding Behavior Analysis

An extension for VS Code to provide an analysis of coding behavior like coding speed and coding accuracy.

## Features

At current stage, by launching the CBA extension, you can see your coding speed and accuracy in the status bar of VS Code. An example is shown as follows.

## TODO

1. Aside from the evaluation of CPS(Character Per Second), It may be necessary to evaluate WPS(Word Per Second).
2. Plot a broken line graph to show the change of CPS and Accuracy.
3. Mine the coding content and analyze it for more interesting conclusion.
